Difficulty: Extremely Difficult
Recommended Language: C++
Problem Statement:
Implement a SAT solver using the DPLL algorithm (or a more optimized variant).
Input: a Boolean formula in DIMACS CNF format. Output: "SAT" and a satisfying
assignment or "UNSAT" if no assignment exists. Optimize to handle moderately
large instances.
