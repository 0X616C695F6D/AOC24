Difficulty: Very Hard
Recommended Language: Python
Problem Statement:
Implement AES-128 encryption in pure Python (no external crypto libraries).
Given a 128-bit key and a plaintext block (128 bits), perform all AES steps
(SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, AddRoundKey) and print the resulting
ciphertext block in hex.
