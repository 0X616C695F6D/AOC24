Difficulty: Easy
Recommended Language: Python
Problem Statement:
Implement a program to compute the Nth Fibonacci number modulo 1,000,000,007.
The input provides N (0 ≤ N ≤ 10^7). Output the Nth Fibonacci number under the
given modulus. Optimize to handle large N efficiently (e.g., using fast doubling
or matrix exponentiation).
