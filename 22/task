Difficulty: Extremely Difficult
Recommended Language: Ada
Problem Statement:
Implement a microkernel-style message-passing system. Simulate multiple
processes as Ada tasks. Ensure tasks are isolated and communicate only via
well-defined message channels. Add basic security checks: tasks should only
receive messages from authorized senders.
