What:
-----
My personal 'Advent of Code' for year 2024.

I did not enjoy any of the challenges on the official advent of code website,
for the first couple of days. Instead I tasked gpt to help curate challenges.

How:
----
Forced gpt to stick with c, c++, and python for language recommendations.

I also hinted towards networking, security and some ML.

Difficulty of challenges are meant to increase per-day from easy to extremely
hard. 

Missed:
-------
Some days are obviously missing and no challenge was completed for that date.

Days:
-----
1: Compute the Nth fibonacci number
2: Sum large signed integers
3: Compute kadane on 2D matrix
4: Ceaser cipher encrypt/decrypt
7: HTTP client using raw TCP sockets
8: RSA key generation tool using Miller-Rabin and BÃ©zout's identity
10: Logistic regression from scratch with IRIS dataset
13: Sniff network traffic using raw sockets, providing traffic summary
18: Parse ELF files for symbol table, symbol names, and addresses

Note:
-----
Day 13 project was super interesting to me and I had additional ideas on
extending it to something worthwhile.

A new project spawned, called 'shark' on my gh.

Use of LLMs:
------------
Yes LLMs were used to help with coding. As tutors. Not to provide full
solutions. LLMs are useful for teaching coding, when used sparsely.
