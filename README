My personal 'Advent of Code' for year 2024.


I did not enjoy any of the challenges on aoc this year.
So, I decided to create my own... generated using gpt.


I forced it to stick with c, c++, python and ada.
Obviously I know how to program in c and python, but not much in c++ and ada
outside of class, so this'll be interesting.


The problems were also solved using the help of gpt, but as a tutor instead of a
personal programmer. Point of doing all this obviously is to have fun and learn
a lot while doing so.
