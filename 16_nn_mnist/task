Difficulty: Extremely Difficult
Recommended Language: Python
Problem Statement:
Implement a small neural network from scratch to classify MNIST-like data. Load
the dataset (provided as binary files), create a fully connected feed-forward
network, implement backpropagation, train for several epochs, and print final
accuracy. No ML libraries allowedâ€”just raw Python and math.
