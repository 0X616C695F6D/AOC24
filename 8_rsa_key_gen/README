Recommended Language: C
Problem Statement:
Implement a basic RSA key generation tool. Given a random seed, generate two
large prime numbers (using a simple probabilistic test), compute N, Ï†(N), e, and
d. Print the public (N, e) and private (N, d) keys. Keep everything self-
contained, no large libraries.
