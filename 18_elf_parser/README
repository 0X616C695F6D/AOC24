Difficulty: Extremely Difficult
Recommended Language: C
Problem Statement:
Write an ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) parser. Given a path to an ELF
binary, parse it manually and print the symbol table, including symbol names
and addresses. Use no external parsing libraries; rely on official ELF
specifications.

ELF files:
+ ELF header
+ data
	+ Program header table >0 memory segments
	+ Section header table >0 sections
	+ data referred to in the program/section headers

+ Any byte in the entire file can be owned by one section at most, and
  orphaned bytes can occur which are unowned by any section!
