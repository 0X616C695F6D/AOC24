Difficulty: Extremely Difficult
Recommended Language: C++
Problem Statement:
Create a real-time 3D rigid-body physics simulation. Input: a scene with
multiple polyhedral objects in a box. Simulate gravity, collisions, and
restitution. Output frame-by-frame positions and velocities. Efficiently
implement collision detection and numerical integration.
